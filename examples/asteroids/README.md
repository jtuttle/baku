# Asteroids Example

This is a simple Asteroids clone using Gosu with Baku. It is still a work-in-progress but currently shows examples of several useful features such as sprite rendering and player movement.

# Running the Game

```
git clone git@github.com:jtuttle/baku-examples.git
cd baku-examples/asteroids
bundle install
ruby asteroids.rb
```

You can control the ship with the arrow keys and shoot your laser with the space bar.
